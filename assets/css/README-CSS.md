## Stylesheets

[Blueprint][bp] is the standard CSS framework. It has everything you need and a lot more. So use it...

BP can (and should) be customized to each project specific needs. That's why it's not included in this starter-kit. Learn how to [customize it using the compressor][bp-compressor].

### What's Inside?

* __style.css__ - reset, font normalization and some base styles. adaptable to iOS, Android and Opera Mobile.
* __handheld.css__ - stylesheet for the less-enabled mobile browsers like Opera Mini.

The CSS on these files are provided just for convenient sake, just in case a project doesn't require Blueprint -- BP already provides a solid base stylesheet. Otherwise you can replace the contents of these files with your own.
