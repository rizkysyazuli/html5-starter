## Font Assets

If you are using some sort of text replacement method please follow these simple guides. Otherwise you can safely delete this folder.

* Files related to [@font-face][ff], [Cufon][cf], [sIFR][sifr] or other text replacement should be placed inside this folder.
* For better compatibility, use __@font-face__ files generated from [Font Squirrel Generator][generator].
* Multiple typefaces should be separated into different sub-folders.
