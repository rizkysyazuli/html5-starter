## Stylesheets

[Blueprint][bp] is the standard CSS framework. It has everything you need and a lot more. So use it...

BP can (and should) be customized to each project specific needs. That's why it's not included in this starter-kit. Learn how to [customize it using the compressor][bp-compressor].

The "src" folder is for custom stylesheets that you want to compile along with BP.

### What's Inside?

Just in case a project doesn't use Blueprint, a CSS skeleton is already included.

* __style.css__ - reset, font normalization and some base styles. adaptable to iOS, Android and Opera Mobile.
* __handheld.css__ - stylesheet for the less-enabled mobile browsers like Opera Mini.

Otherwise you can replace the contents of the "__style.css__" file with your own CSS (maybe not the media queries, you might need that). BP already provides a solid base stylesheet.
