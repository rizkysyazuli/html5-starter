## Stylesheets

[Blueprint][bp] is the standard CSS framework. It has everything you need and a lot more. So use it...

BP can be customized to each project specific needs. That is why it's not included in this starter-kit. Learn how to [customize it using the compressor][bp-compressor].

The "src" folder is for custom stylesheets that you want to compile along with BP.

### Anything else?

Just in case a project doesn't require BP, a CSS skeleton is already included. Otherwise it's safe to delete these.

* __style.css__ - contains a reset, font normalization and some base styles.
* __mobile.css__ - stylesheet for iOS, Android, Opera Mobile with media queries.
* __handheld.css__ - stylesheet for the less-enabled mobile browsers like Opera Mini.
